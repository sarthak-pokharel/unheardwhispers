1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
DOCTOR: I'm a time traveller.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,720
DOCTOR: I'm stuck in 1969.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,960
MARTHA: We're stuck.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,480
MARTHA: All of space and time, he promised me.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,640
MARTHA: Now I've got a job in a shop

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
MARTHA: I've got to support him!

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,520
MALCOLM: I'm sorry

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,280
SALLY: I've seen this bit before.

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,200
DOCTOR: Quite possibly.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,160
SALLY: 1969, that's where you're talking from?

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,840
DOCTOR: 'Fraid so.

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,920
SALLY: But you're replying to me.

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,480
SALLY: You can't know exactly what I'm gonna say

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,320
SALLY: 40 years before I say it!

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,400
DOCTOR: 38.

16
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,560
LARRY: I'm getting this down!

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
LARRY: I'm writing in your bits.

18
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,400
SALLY: How?

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,360
SALLY: How is this possible?

20
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,159
SALLY: Tell me.

21
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,160
LARRY: Not so fast.

22
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,440
DOCTOR: People don't understand time.

23
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,839
DOCTOR: It's not what you think it is.

24
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:38,080
SALLY: Then what is it?

25
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,040
DOCTOR: Complicated.

26
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,560
SALLY: Tell me.

27
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,480
DOCTOR: Very complicated.

28
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,840
SALLY: I'm clever and I'm listening.

29
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,959
SALLY: And don't patronise me because people have died

30
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,440
SALLY: and I'm not happy.

31
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
SALLY: Tell me!

32
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,519
DOCTOR: People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect

33
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,519
LARRY: Of course he can't hear us.

34
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,320
DOCTOR: but actually from a non-linear

35
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,280
DOCTOR: it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly

36
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,920
SALLY: Like you can hear me.

37
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,560
DOCTOR: timey-wimey stuff.

38
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,960
SALLY: Yeah, I've seen this bit before.

39
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,879
SALLY: You said that sentence got away from you.

40
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,640
DOCTOR: It got away from me, yeah.

41
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,720
SALLY: Next thing you're going to say is

42
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
DOCTOR: Well, I can hear you.

43
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,920
SALLY: This isn't possible.

44
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,040
LARRY: It's brilliant!

45
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,280
DOCTOR: Not hear you exactly

46
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,440
SALLY: You're going to need it.

47
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,440
LARRY: Always gives me the shivers, that bit.

48
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,160
SALLY: How can you know what I'm going to say?

49
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,320
DOCTOR: Look to your left.

50
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,120
LARRY: What does he mean by, "Look to your left"?

51
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,760
LARRY: I've written tons about that on the forums.

52
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,840
LARRY: I think it's a political statement.

53
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,560
SALLY: He means you.

54
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,920
SALLY: What are you doing?

55
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,000
LARRY: I'm writing in your bits.

56
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,880
DOCTOR: I've got a copy of the finished transcript.

57
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,160
LARRY: So I've got a complete transcript of the whole conversation.

58
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,480
LARRY: Wait until this hits the net.

59
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,280
LARRY: This will explode the egg forums.

60
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,920
SALLY: How can you have a copy of the finished transcript?

61
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,600
SALLY: How could he get the transcript?

62
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
SALLY: It is still being written.

63
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280
DOCTOR: I'm a time traveller.

64
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,640
DOCTOR: I got it in the future.

65
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,440
SALLY: Okay, let me get my head 'round this.

66
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,920
SALLY: You're reading from a transcript of a conversation you're still

67
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,840
BEN: You're in Hull.

68
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
SALLY: Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.

69
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
SALLY: Gimme a name.

70
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,600
SALLY: Actually, never mind that.

71
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,080
SALLY: (To Larry): You can do shorthand?

72
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,600
LARRY: So?

73
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
DOCTOR: What matters is we can communicate.

74
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,280
DOCTOR: We have got big problems now.

75
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,480
DOCTOR: They've taken the blue box, haven't they?

76
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,280
DOCTOR: The angels have the phone box.

77
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,800
LARRY: The angels have the phone box!

78
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,520
DOCTOR: That's me.

79
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,240
LARRY: That's my favourite, I've got it on a tee-shirt!

80
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,120
SALLY: What do you mean, angels?

81
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,480
SALLY: You mean those statue things?

82
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
DOCTOR: Creatures from another world.

83
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,640
SALLY: But they're just statues.

84
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,040
DOCTOR: Only when you see them.

85
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,120
SALLY: What does that mean?

86
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,480
DOCTOR: Lonely assassins, they were called.

87
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,960
DOCTOR: No-one knows where they came from.

88
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,080
DOCTOR: They're as old as the universe, or very nearly.

89
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,560
DOCTOR: They've survived this long as they have the most perfect

90
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,480
DOCTOR: defence system ever evolved.

91
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
DOCTOR: They are quantum-locked.

92
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,800
DOCTOR: They don't exist when being observed.

93
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,880
DOCTOR: The moment they're seen by any other living creature they

94
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,760
DOCTOR: freeze into rock.

95
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,560
DOCTOR: It's a fact of their biology.

96
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
DOCTOR: In the sight of any living thing

97
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,600
DOCTOR: they literally turn to stone.

98
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,120
DOCTOR: And you can't k*ll a stone.

99
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,720
DOCTOR: Course, a stone can't k*ll you either.

100
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,680
DOCTOR: But then you turn your head away

101
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,400
DOCTOR: then you blink

102
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,720
DOCTOR: yes it can!

103
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,160
SALLY: Don't take your eyes off that.

104
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,720
DOCTOR: That's why they cover their eyes.

105
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,320
DOCTOR: They're coming.

106
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,360
LARRY: They're looking at each other.

107
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,160
DOCTOR: Their greatest asset is their greatest curse.

108
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,720
DOCTOR: They can never be seen.

109
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,440
DOCTOR: The loneliest creatures in the universe.

110
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,640
MALCOLM: I'm sorry

111
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,720
DOCTOR: And I'm sorry, Billy, I am very, very sorry.

112
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,680
DOCTOR: it's up to you now.

113
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
SALLY: What am I supposed to do?

114
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,480
DOCTOR: The blue box, it's my time machine.

115
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,120
DOCTOR: There is a world of time energy in there they

116
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,280
DOCTOR: could feast on forever.

117
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,360
DOCTOR: The damage they can do can switch off the sun.

118
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,320
DOCTOR: You have got to send it back to me!

119
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,680
SALLY: How?

120
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
SALLY: Kathy?

121
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,240
LARRY: And that's okay.

122
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,560
DOCTOR: There's no more from you on the transcript

123
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,000
DOCTOR: that's all I've got.

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,160
DOCTOR: I dunno what stopped you talking, but I can guess.

125
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,880
DOCTOR: but I know everything you're going to say.

126
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,360
DOCTOR: The angels are coming for you.

127
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,920
DOCTOR: Your life could depend on this.

128
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,200
DOCTOR: Don't blink!

129
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,160
DOCTOR: Don't even blink.

130
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,440
DOCTOR: Blink and you're dead.

131
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,400
DOCTOR: They are fast, faster than you can believe.

132
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,720
DOCTOR: Don't turn your back.

133
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,200
DOCTOR: Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink.

134
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,680
DOCTOR: Good luck.
